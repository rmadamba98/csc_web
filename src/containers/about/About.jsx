              desc="Our care approach is grounded in applied behavior analysis, an evidence-based best practice treatment based on the science of behavior. We believe that behavior can be changed along the same lines that it was learned: through experience, change in habit, and improvement of adaptive skills over time. We try not to change the person, but to change the personâ€™s behavior, and we do this by focusing on their internal and external environment. Our goal is to establish and enhance behavior that is important to our client's development and overall health."
